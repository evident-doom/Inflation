/**
 * The state of a running hex model saved to a file and loaded back into a freshly built one, so that
 * a long run can be carried on after small fixes to the code instead of started anew.
 *
 * What is saved is everything that changes as the model runs: the weather, the land and its plants
 * and water, the residents, small life and water life, the groups, the eruptions. The world itself
 * (terrain, rivers, climate normals, the hexes) is not saved: it is generated again from the seed.
 *
 * It goes by field names, not by layout: a field the code no longer has is dropped, a field the
 * saved state lacks keeps what the fresh model gave it, an array that has grown (a kind added at its
 * end) keeps the fresh model's values past the saved ones, and an array that has shrunk is taken as saved. So small changes to
 * the code still load; large ones (a different map) are refused.
